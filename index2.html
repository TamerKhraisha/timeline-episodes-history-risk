    "evidence": "During the 1920s in the United States, the stock and real estate markets were experiencing a boom in their activities. Millions of American citizens started depositing their saving in the commercial banks. These banks however were using this money as a collateral against the bets in stock and financial markets. Citizens had no legal protection against what commercial banks were doing and the separation between investment and commercial banks were absent. Kuhn Loeb, Lehman Brothers, Goldman Sachs, Brown Brothers Harriman and of course Jp Morgan & Company were some of the most recognized names of what had become an American elite. In the 1920, the financial power of these Wall Street bankers grew in an astonishing way, gaining economic and political power.",

Firms held a percentage of 10% of customer receivables and proprietary positions as capital. By 1929, the New York Stock Exchange had established well defined capital requirements. According to Holton(), this requirement was the beginning to what will evolve later to become capital requirements for financial firms. It also evolved into the Value at Risk model that financial institutions use these days. ",
